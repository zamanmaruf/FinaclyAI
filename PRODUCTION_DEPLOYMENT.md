# Production Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Verification

### Environment Variables
- [ ] All required environment variables are set
- [ ] `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` is valid and active
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is 32+ characters
- [ ] `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is 64-character hex string
- [ ] Stripe keys are valid (test/live as appropriate)
- [ ] Plaid credentials are valid
- [ ] QuickBooks credentials are valid

### Database Setup
- [ ] Database is running and accessible
- [ ] All tables exist with proper schema
- [ ] Indexes are created for performance
- [ ] `exchange_rates` table is created
- [ ] Database migrations are applied

### Code Quality
- [ ] Build passes with exit code 0
- [ ] All TypeScript errors are resolved
- [ ] No mock data or hardcoded values remain
- [ ] All API routes use standardized responses
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Logging is structured and secure

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run the exchange rates table migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/create-exchange-rates-table.sql

# Verify all tables exist
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.production

# Fill in production values
# - Use live API keys for production
# - Set NODE_ENV=production
# - Configure proper database URLs
# - Set up proper logging levels
```

### 3. Build and Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# Run build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run production tests
npm run test:production
```

### 4. Security Verification
- [ ] All secrets are properly encrypted
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] API keys are not exposed in client code
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured

## ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Reconciliation Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Auto-match Rate**: Target >90%
- **API Response Times**: Target <2 seconds
- **Database Query Performance**: Target <100ms
- **Error Rates**: Target <1%

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Database performance monitoring
- [ ] External API monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist

### Data Protection
- [ ] All PII is encrypted at rest
- [ ] API communications use HTTPS
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Secrets are stored securely
- [ ] Access controls are properly configured

### Audit Trail
- [ ] All actions are logged with audit trail
- [ ] Hash chain is maintained for integrity
- [ ] User actions are tracked
- [ ] System events are logged
- [ ] Audit logs are immutable

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Connect Stripe â†’ Ingest payouts â†’ Match to bank â†’ Create QBO deposit
- [ ] Test idempotency: Run same action twice, verify no duplicates
- [ ] Test exception handling: Disconnect provider mid-sync
- [ ] Test FX conversion: Multi-currency transaction handling
- [ ] Load test: 10k transactions processed in <5 minutes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Stripe API integration works
- [ ] Plaid API integration works
- [ ] QuickBooks API integration works
- [ ] Exchange rate API integration works
- [ ] All external APIs handle rate limits

### Security Tests
- [ ] Authentication and authorization work
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Audit trail captures all security events

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Criteria

- âœ… Idempotency guaranteed for all write operations
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling with structured logging
- âœ… All environment variables validated on startup
- âœ… Type safety enforced throughout codebase

### Performance Requirements
- âœ… Reconciliation completes in <5 minutes for 10k transactions
- âœ… API responses return in <2 seconds
- âœ… Database queries execute in <100ms
- âœ… System handles 100+ concurrent users
- âœ… Memory usage stays within limits

### Security Requirements
- âœ… All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- âœ… No secrets in logs or client code
- âœ… Proper access controls and authentication
- âœ… Complete audit trail for all operations
- âœ… Regular security updates and monitoring

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous version
2. **Database**: Restore from backup if needed
3. **Environment**: Switch back to staging environment
4. **Monitoring**: Check all system health metrics
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of issues

### Monitoring During Deployment
- [ ] Application health checks
- [ ] Database performance metrics
- [ ] External API response times
- [ ] Error rates and types
- [ ] User experience metrics
